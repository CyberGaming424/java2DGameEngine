This is a 2D Game engine I am creating in Java.
A "Getting Started" page has been provided in the wiki.
The Wiki can be used to learn how to use this. The Wiki can be found above.

### Editing
I will accept and look over all proposed additions to this engine at this time

### Wiki
It might be a little behind, as I'm trying to push more and more updates out. When I get time (or more collaborators), it will be updated to the newest version. I am sorry for any inconviences this has caused.
