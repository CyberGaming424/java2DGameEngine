# java2DGameEngine
This is a 2D Game engine I am creating in Java for commercial use.
Examples of usage can be found in [examples](src/examples/)
###### Editing
Currently, I would like it if any issues or concerns would be put in the issues category. I will not be accepting any changes made directly from the community at this time. This is due to the project not even being close to finished yet. When I get to a point where I feel that the project is usable in all situations and games, I will gladly open it up to the public's discression.
